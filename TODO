Add incremental backups to as to revert to another conf, maybe in /var/db/.
You can get rid of this manual editing, right?:

[SCRIPT]
first_run = True

Since the script needs to run as root, and the files you're copying are all pretty small, you can create dirs. inside, 
say, /var/db/<script-name> based on, let's say, date +%s (+ a pristine directory for the first-run backup). This way, one can make multiple changes, 
and then roll-back to any of the previous versions. Do a diff even. etc...
